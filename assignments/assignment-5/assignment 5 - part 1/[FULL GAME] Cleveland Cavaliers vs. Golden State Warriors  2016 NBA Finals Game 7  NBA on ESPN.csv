00:53,53.06,5.50,change Festus is healing Andrew Bogut out with a knee injury Andre Iguodala will come
00:59,58.56,5.13,off the bench Burroughs Ely his first start of the entire postseason he
01:04,63.69,9.20,started 13 games during the regular season he has been a terrific backup Center tonight the starting role
01:13,73.32,7.08,these finals had to add a little bit of everything some great team plays unbelievable individual performances
01:20,80.40,6.78,suspensions and ejection off court drama the one thing we haven't had yet is a close game let's see if that happens
01:27,87.18,5.55,tonight JR Smith misses does Hill he can't control it but curry tips to the
01:33,92.73,6.33,bones and Mike right away we see draymond Green starting defense Lee against LeBron James trying to make sure
01:39,99.06,6.00,they keep him outside in the paint area and force him to be a jump shooter Green
01:45,105.06,6.36,was not pleased with his performance in Game six said he was too tentative vasily can't get at the ball and James
01:51,111.42,7.83,the rebound guys you both have been a part of game sevens you've both been a part of the finals but butterflies in
01:59,119.25,6.57,the nerves have to be unbelievable as Thompson goes inside and lays it in how do you get it to settle down but you
02:06,125.82,6.30,got to continue to remind yourself that is just another game sure the intensity show of the moment sure the sense of
02:12,132.12,5.43,urgency but don't get out of character the same things that put you into position will put you in position to be
02:18,137.55,7.29,a champ klay Thompson drives rain fakes bring up to a ceiling who misses from
02:25,144.84,6.06,point-blank range James comes out of the pack fakes drives on Barnes left-handed
02:31,150.90,10.49,banks it in and as Ely said to quality looks to start the game which starts have been
02:41,161.39,5.28,critical recently as Curry's way off the mark Thompson gets the rebound for the
02:47,166.67,5.16,Cleveland Cavaliers what they did the start Game six was unreal one of the
02:52,171.83,6.99,more dominant first quarters you'll ever see in a playoff game as breed throws it down on a beautiful feed from the
02:59,178.82,6.72,ceiling and a good job little split action in the lack of communication from Thompson and James allowed draymond
03:06,185.54,8.03,Green to Brooklyn to the cup Kevin Love looking to post-up play Thompson on him
03:14,193.57,7.65,shot clock at 6 love double team finds junior Smith launches at three-pointer
03:21,201.40,5.65,love's got to catch that deeper or he's inviting the double teams green again to
03:27,207.05,5.13,a ceiling and he's fouled on the entry passes Tristan Thompson will pick up his
03:32,212.18,5.31,first [Applause] Tristan Thompson says he didn't call
03:37,217.49,5.49,switch this is a big to big pic as far as Thompson and James good job by the
03:43,222.98,5.36,Warriors creating that confusion and a great pass from Azealia Barnes
03:48,228.34,5.71,boy must that feel good Barnes in the last two games 2 for 22
03:54,234.05,6.81,and he had missed his last 14 shots from the field inexcusably and inexplicably
04:01,240.86,6.72,they were not matched up on the side out of bounds James on the pull-up bounces
04:08,247.58,8.34,off hurry the rebound this place is deafening already bring up
04:16,255.92,4.70,top again Barnes Green for three
04:33,272.61,6.74,Irving on the drive pulls up shot bounces off the rim is hilly falls it in
04:40,280.49,5.65,Thompson for three morning adrenaline must be flowing right
04:46,286.14,7.71,now a pretty quick pace to start James guarded by Steph Curry with swinging in
04:54,293.85,8.31,the ball love can't hit rebound Tristan Thompson can't hold on warriors ball love the energy in this
05:02,302.16,6.33,building this crowd is as good as it gets we said the other night may have been
05:08,308.49,7.50,the lattice we heard Quicken Loans Arena this might be the loudest we've heard this building but on that drive James
05:16,315.99,6.68,versus courage don't drive to pass drive to score Seeley blocked by Thompson
05:23,322.67,9.04,terrific defensive play from Tristan Thompson who has been marvelous this series Kevin Love goes it is healing
05:32,331.71,7.95,misses love's tip won't go love takes it away from Mazzilli excellent second
05:40,339.66,5.28,effort from Kevin Love it's been a difficult series for love
05:45,344.94,6.33,had the concussion missed again came off the bench game on the return from the
05:51,351.27,3.38,concussion as Barnes drives
05:57,357.47,5.76,James goes that draymond Green bad pass intended for Thompson and the first
06:03,363.23,6.78,turnover of the game the coach talked about it as well a bran James got to put his head down and attack go look to
06:10,370.01,6.78,finish as opposed to going in looking to kick out make a play but Green did an outstanding job of leveling him off and
06:17,376.79,10.13,making it him go away from the basket topsis lazuli tips it the right to James
06:30,389.81,5.19,the cavalier offense the last couple of games have been so efficient as Kyrie
06:35,395.00,7.44,Irving nails that one in last two games they shot over 50% from the field that
06:42,402.44,6.33,that included Game five here in the victory at Oracle Arena and a timeout
06:49,408.77,6.42,called and this is good defense from klay Thompson did a great job by Steph Curry showing and getting back Thompson
06:55,415.19,6.95,does his job keeping them in front active hands contest that's just great offense by Kyrie Irving a spectacular
07:02,422.14,7.99,offensive weapons continue to have his way [Music]
07:16,435.95,5.56,the Gazala last year's finals MVP will guard LeBron James most of the Wayne's
07:22,441.51,5.37,when he's out there curry four to shoot finds a little room fires
07:27,446.88,2.78,hits a three
07:34,454.38,10.12,and you see for the first time Steve Carr gets his Ely out and he goes with that infamous small lineup they are
07:45,464.50,5.88,spitting Mazzilli gave them some good minutes to start the game as James goes
07:50,470.38,6.87,inside kicks it out to Irvin little fate two-point jumper that won't go rebound love haven't lost it and it's still
07:57,477.25,7.11,gonna be Cavs ball his dream on dream touch the glass I really like Kevin love's aggressiveness on the offensive board
08:04,484.36,6.75,that's what he's a lead at do what you're best at Green goes out to guard
08:11,491.11,9.06,junior Smith Smith drives to the basket layup is good he's mixed it up nicely
08:20,500.17,6.17,between his three-point shooting and some drives to the basket all five starters have scores for Cleveland
08:26,506.34,6.25,Lawrence tries again that's good basketball Mike that's very good
08:33,512.59,6.57,basketball good point making pull the Warriors those are shots that Steve Kerr will live with Barnes has been in a huge
08:39,519.16,5.94,struggle that's why the first three so important seat curtailing just go out rebound and defend everything will take
08:45,525.10,8.22,care of itself shot clock at six high and the second turnover by LeBron James who has really
08:53,533.32,6.87,kept his turnovers down and as you talked about at the top mark what he's done the past two games not just the 41
09:00,540.19,5.85,points but the overall play 82 points 24 rebounds and 18 assists in back-to-back
09:06,546.04,6.03,elimination games unbelievable numbers that last possession you could see the adjustment that the war is made sure
09:12,552.07,5.25,Curry gets on the Bron James but the double-team is coming quick ball touched
09:17,557.32,7.01,out of bounds along the baseline first turnover for Golden State as we listen to a Steve Kerr huddle
09:25,564.98,6.30,we just did a little bit of a rush which it's game seven we're all pumped up and everything no problem right but get the
09:31,571.28,6.57,Momo in the first few possessions we got it moving we got great stuff okay last couple we've taken some quick shot
09:38,577.85,7.17,keep it moving last two games they've shot just 36%
09:45,585.02,5.28,from the field and 40% it's the best offensive team in the NBA all season but
09:50,590.30,5.04,the Cavs have been superb defensively James taken away by draymond Green
09:55,595.34,6.95,[Applause]
10:02,602.29,5.08,Thompson the height advantage on Irving Jefferson goes to help Thompson able
10:07,607.37,2.42,attack
10:17,616.68,6.40,[Applause] Thompson guarding Irving down the other end he's been guarding all-star players
10:23,623.08,5.40,throughout these playoffs James fires away a three-pointer too strong draymond
10:28,628.48,5.07,Green grabs another curry got sloppy
10:34,633.55,6.89,with a dribble and Jefferson picks up the Aaron Paul James to Jefferson Jefferson goes right at draymond Green
10:40,640.44,7.00,how great has he been this series for a guy who was committed to Dallas and then
10:47,647.44,7.02,Dallas led him out of that commitment when James decided to go back to Cleveland just so impactful in this
10:54,654.46,6.75,series curry leans in can't hit rebound James again jr. Smith releases and lays
11:01,661.21,6.36,it in beautiful pass and Smith with the easy bucket and those are the shots that you cannot give up you're the Warriors
11:08,667.57,5.37,long shot but you must give back poor job getting back in transition
11:13,672.94,5.39,I thought curry got nudged from behind by junior Smith klay Thompson for three
11:18,678.33,5.62,that's their fourth three-pointer already four of nine from downtown and
11:24,683.95,6.54,Mike that's the action that gave him so many problems klay Thompson when he comes up he's never setting the screen
11:30,690.49,6.07,he slipped out it gives the switch problem gets the wide open look
11:37,696.56,5.41,[Applause] Marie helps out Smith pass right through
11:42,701.97,6.54,the hands of Perry James but two-handed slam Curie had that steel but it slipped
11:49,708.51,14.70,through his hands and LeBron James takes advantage Harrison Barnes not hesitant
12:03,723.21,9.51,at all too strong and Barnes is 1 for 4 James felt some contact missed the shot
12:13,732.72,7.38,picked up by curry Mary coming off his first career ejection in game 6 as
12:20,740.10,6.27,Barnes good look just can't get it to fall and he struggles with those a good
12:26,746.37,5.70,look those are quality trips on the offensive end if you're Harrison Barnes you got to continue to look to take and
12:32,752.07,6.36,make those shots timeout tyronn lue see the almost turnover the curry unable to
12:38,758.43,5.94,catch the basketball James just sees the rim in mama call of clay i'ma call him dunked on
12:44,764.37,7.67,big-time finish by James [Music] a chance for their first title in
12:52,772.04,5.79,franchise history not since Jim Brown and the Browns beat the Colts back in 64
12:58,777.83,5.28,and are also working to make NBA history no team ever in the finals of go back
13:03,783.11,10.86,from a 3-1 deficit in fact these Cavaliers only the third team to force a game 7 mega dolla
13:14,793.97,6.95,with the steal you can just see at least early the way he's moving so much better
13:21,800.92,7.12,than he did when he entered the back in Game six you can't turn the ball over like this against superior competition
13:28,808.04,7.62,curry very shell packed the curry corner three five three-pointers in the opening
13:36,815.66,6.18,period for Golden State for one thing playing with the Hall of Famer Reggie Miller I was in awe of his
13:42,821.84,5.64,ability to continue to move without the basketball that was a thing of beauty the way to express it at Steph Curry to
13:47,827.48,5.51,put on Kyrie relief to the fan Irving pulls up stops on a dime and banks it in
13:53,832.99,5.05,that's what klay Thompson said was so difficult about defending Irving his
13:58,838.04,7.08,ability to just stop on a dime as Kevin lob fouls Andy Varejao well
14:05,845.12,5.25,they run a little misdirection to get Irving in the pick-and-roll good balance
14:10,850.37,5.07,and banks at home this terrific defense
14:15,855.44,6.06,by Irving but right now listen Cleveland's within one but this is the
14:22,861.50,7.52,tough this is a tough time right now they've already given up five threes bringing the drive will a pan
14:30,869.65,5.39,and it have been more defensive mistakes than they've made in the last two games
14:35,875.04,9.25,their defense has been sensational in these last two Richard Jefferson goes at
14:44,884.29,5.21,Livingston Kevin Love the offensive rebound back up he's foul shot won't go
14:49,889.50,5.44,Steph Curry picks up his first mehran James getting the rest to the end
14:55,894.94,7.26,of the first Steph Curry and klay Thompson they're gonna need all the guys to make plays tonight draymond Green puts the ball on the deck attacks
15:02,902.20,5.10,Richard Jefferson got his mind made up you're Kyrie Irving you're in position
15:07,907.30,7.53,to help you have to come and put a body in front of draymond Green Curry who fouled out in Game six first time since
15:15,914.83,4.07,2013 that happened picks up his first
15:29,928.60,6.04,love misses the second even though it's the last game the NBA
15:35,934.64,5.04,has become a twelvemonth of year league always something going on and as curry
15:40,939.68,13.20,gets inside kicks it out big adalat rides a three way off and loves the rebound junior Smith long distance can
15:53,952.88,5.91,hit love another offensive board he's got six boards here on the first
15:59,958.79,6.00,gets inside block but foul by berry Chou and a very heaven love down low attack
16:05,964.79,6.12,Oh what coach talked about I love the energy of Kevin Love the start this ball game he's got his mind made up attacking
16:11,970.91,6.39,the offensive boards securing the basketball looking to be aggressive this is a flop like Varejao
16:17,977.30,5.43,good job by not calling it clearly contact the Kevin Love playing with great energy effort and enthusiasm
16:23,982.73,7.71,stocked his game he's averaging just over five rebounds a game in the finals he already has exceeded that here in the
16:30,990.44,7.11,first quarter and for those on the offensive end Mike he had 13 offensive rebounds and 13
16:38,997.55,5.82,rebounds in the first game 14 cents this is what he's got to get back to this is
16:43,1003.37,5.57,who he is well certainly the three-point shot the
16:49,1008.94,5.31,way the game has changed has caused him to change it but it's been so drastic it really has taken away a lot of his
16:54,1014.25,8.19,strengths but the things he was able to do him Minnesota he can still do today it's a mindset bearish out drives
17:02,1022.44,8.64,left-handed as he felt the bump and that's going to be never love second foul Andy Varejao of a former Cavalier
17:11,1031.08,5.88,traded this year a beloved figure in Cleveland for a long time well love's
17:17,1036.96,7.35,got him going away from the basket right here that's clearly a foul and you've just got to make him finish that you
17:24,1044.31,6.96,already have one foul you're too good and too valuable their jaw has not
17:31,1051.27,7.23,played a lot of minutes but he's had an impact in example Game seven in the Western Conference Finals against OKC he
17:39,1058.50,5.70,had about a two-minute stretch we really helped turn things around in that victory and that advanced them to the
17:44,1064.20,5.73,finals he was disappointed he was traded traded to Portland let go and then
17:50,1069.93,5.64,signed by Golden State his wonderful Bron James favorite teammates in his
17:56,1075.57,6.45,career in Cleveland at 11 and a half years with the Cavaliers love another
18:02,1082.02,6.08,rebound when we see Bob Olsen to close out this quarter for Steph Curry the guy to gave
18:08,1088.10,6.75,up a lot of quality minutes in this series two-speed current warriors it was about a second and a half difference
18:15,1094.85,6.24,between the shot clock and game clock Barbosa picks up James James goes right
18:21,1101.09,7.05,at him and draws the foul and James will shoot his first free throws of the night raises his arm as he walked past a
18:28,1108.14,5.76,couple of the Warriors and to me coach in doing the warrior you're doing the Cavs a favor
18:34,1113.90,5.04,if you're switching Barbosa a curry or any of the small gods on LeBron James is
18:39,1118.94,6.48,too easy I'd much rather have dream on green on doing it now on defending a
18:45,1125.42,7.47,little small contact but this is game 7 you can live with that but I'd rather have those guys staying connected to LeBron yeah I agreed that the switch of
18:53,1132.89,6.42,the small unto him whether it's curry or Barbosa he can eat just too overpowering
18:59,1139.31,7.26,keep your size on him and this times
19:07,1146.57,5.40,when you have to but in this situation if we Dalek it it went underneath the screen and got back to the body of James
19:12,1151.97,5.25,once he sees ball bowl saw curry oh no his mind is made up to attack and force
19:17,1157.22,3.47,help I'll make a play at the rim
19:23,1162.63,6.69,ahran sits down marreese Speights will check in for the first time and Mike this is where Shumpert and the Cavs
19:29,1169.32,8.78,can't make a mistake Curry's too good late quarter you've got to make the ball go to somebody else other than curry
19:40,1179.72,5.62,James hits affair final seconds curry tied up to the
19:45,1185.34,7.17,adalat not gonna get it off in time that will not count and the first quarter comes to an end
19:53,1192.51,7.08,that's terrific defense right there Mike meanwhile LeBron James six point six
19:60,1199.59,6.87,boards and three assists already the Golden State finding the mark from downtown live at five threes two of them
20:06,1206.46,6.49,from Steph Curry after one Cavs by one [Music]
20:13,1212.95,6.63,your defense the last two games has put you in this position but they made five threes how problematic are those but we
20:20,1219.58,6.84,got to be a little bit between us which is what we're doing defensively I don't think we're executing this as how the level we need to so we've gotta clean up
20:26,1226.42,5.97,a few things defensively but we'll be okay LeBron James affecting the game in all kinds of ways but three early turnovers
20:32,1232.39,5.91,what were those our product up just not being aggressive attacking no trying to think the game just play the game
20:38,1238.30,6.03,I think he's overthinking this got to be aggressive attack the bastard thank you John Livingston the jumper Thank You Doris
20:44,1244.33,6.66,well James is played in obviously so many big games and he's going to play in so many more but you can make a case
20:51,1250.99,6.45,that this is the most important game of his career Jefferson gets inside nice
20:57,1257.44,6.75,fake blocked by Speights picked up by Jefferson throws it back out shut with shot clock did not reset Shumpert off
21:04,1264.19,6.36,the mark space rips down the rebound here comes Iguodala Mo Williams has come
21:11,1270.55,5.73,on here for Cleveland and a ball kicked by Shumpert Thompson tried to go back
21:16,1276.28,5.40,door warriors ball and you see the
21:22,1281.68,7.26,team's trying to figure out how to defend each other James matched up with mo Speights trying to take away his
21:29,1288.94,5.31,ability to pick and pop and Tristan Thompson on draymond Green trying to make sure he's able to defend the
21:34,1294.25,5.19,pick-and-roll and an offensive foul called on draymond Green or is it on
21:39,1299.44,8.54,Thompson he's actually on klay Thompson pushing off the launch help it to get open klay Thompson picks up his first
21:51,1310.61,7.24,there's Williams three-pointer Mo Williams too strong Speights another rebound it's just two on aggressive
21:58,1317.85,5.21,offensively trying to orchestrate too many things
22:03,1323.18,6.94,Livingston shoots over mole Williams not that time rebounding numbers plus eight
22:10,1330.12,5.37,for Cleveland James drives him hard nice adjustment with the left hand
22:15,1335.49,7.31,[Applause] eight points now for James
22:28,1347.57,7.25,Green with Chum perdóname and a foul call on Tristan Thompson
22:38,1357.80,6.43,again don't over think as tyloo said at the quarter break attack a great use of
22:44,1364.23,5.85,slithering by the help defender and a beautiful left hand finish my mistake
22:50,1370.08,8.88,that foul on mo Williams's Green Drive left-handed too strong Speights with the tip won't go tips in a second time green
22:59,1378.96,14.28,and never reestablished back in might when he tucked the ball so considered out of bounds very close though Green
23:13,1393.24,7.65,did not argue officiating crew Danny Crawford Monty McCutchen and Mike Callahan combined they've worked 66

58:08,3488.29,5.10,third quarter of Game seven of the NBA Finals they have a six-point lead and
58:13,3493.39,6.93,guys we talked about this the other night the Warriors again the highest scoring team in the NBA in the past 24
58:20,3500.32,5.43,years yet once again they're shooting 39% is that the Cavaliers strategy is it
58:26,3505.75,6.77,the personnel wive they're so effective and making it difficult to scores Barnes gets inside
58:33,3512.69,6.39,that's good execution out of the timeout but to me you've got to be disciplined against the Warriors defense Lee to give
58:39,3519.08,5.73,yourselves a chance they've been taken and making tough shots all season long Mike and they've gone through a drought
58:45,3524.81,7.35,but you also have to give credit to the Cleveland Cavaliers defense I was born second field goal Kyrie Irving knocks
58:52,3532.16,5.64,down a three Irving having a huge third quarter 12 of
58:58,3537.80,10.86,his 21 that's his first three-pointer and a lead is up to 7 [Applause]

59:21,3560.57,8.04,for Golden State again the crossover the screen gets some
59:29,3568.61,5.43,space raises up knocks it in but it shows you the difference if Steph
59:34,3574.04,5.64,Curry's coming off and that draymond Green defense Lee would be up he's puzzled Tyrese urban ability to get to
59:40,3579.68,5.49,the paint you got to give him a little bit of room elevates and makes the right play and I'll be surprised Mike if
59:45,3585.17,6.33,Golden State goes back to playing either as Ely or Varejao this has been their
59:52,3591.50,5.52,best chance five smaller guys and now the question is can love and Thompson
59:57,3597.02,5.43,stay on the floor defensively Thompson
60:02,3602.45,2.90,on Irving
60:08,3608.22,5.91,Irving looking for that opening green picks him up tries to find Tristan Thompson Tristan Thompson downloads
60:14,3614.13,8.34,struggled and he got bumped by green and they're in the penalty so Tristan Thompson will shoot to second foul on
60:22,3622.47,6.72,draymond Green Mike remember the struggles Tristan Thompson has gone
60:29,3629.19,8.22,through in the finals from the free-throw line a little bit better last game overall just 50% when you see the

61:52,3712.03,5.28,quarter after 22 in the first half every one of these calls will be so
61:57,3717.31,7.80,scrutinized you're at seven you've got a good defensive sequence get going on ball pressure beyond the three it looks
62:05,3725.11,10.92,dead and that could have easily not been called as well draymond Green who was

78:48,4728.37,7.20,floor so they will check to make sure go to the replay and as Crawford over there
78:56,4735.57,5.52,he's saying three point three point attempt so three free throws but to me
79:01,4741.09,5.01,clearly contact by Ezeli he's behind the three-point line the coachella novi
79:06,4746.10,5.10,agree but there's no reason to switch in that situation you're doing the Cavs a
79:11,4751.20,7.32,favor by switching Ozzy Leon's into LeBron and I'll add another one there's no reason to contest coming off your
79:19,4758.52,5.60,feet James has not made a three today
79:24,4764.24,6.09,it's the first free-throw then it's back to three you always have to convince your bigs
79:30,4770.33,5.55,not to leave their feet when they're contestant out here beyond the three
79:36,4775.88,5.57,just put a hand up don't fight I'm Cleveland and you're gonna switch
79:41,4781.45,7.11,that pick-and-roll I'm coming back down and running the same exact action let's see me do it again James now 6 of
79:49,4788.56,5.33,7 from the free-throw line he has done some extraordinary things in his career
79:54,4793.89,5.14,what a victory tonight would be his greatest accomplishment in bringing a
79:59,4799.03,7.89,title back to Cleveland his team down by two with just under five and I have to play and he hits all three clutch free
80:07,4806.92,5.40,throws there Cavaliers talking about how they're going to defend their pick-and-roll with Steph Curry and the
80:12,4812.32,5.57,message comes they want to switch the pick-and-roll now he throws it away an errant pass
80:18,4817.89,7.27,10th turnover for Golden State this a bad play and he knows it a bad decision
80:25,4825.16,7.06,these are the plays that he's got to eliminate especially closing out games and that's his fourth turnover
80:32,4832.22,5.56,[Applause] Lakes is completely slowed down we see
80:38,4837.78,6.51,the big pick and roll again and they switch again good job by draymond Green getting back five to shoot
80:44,4844.29,7.80,Azealia again goes back up on him game steps back for three pops it in LeBron James from downtown and the Cavaliers go
80:52,4852.09,7.14,up by two 26 for James Thompson gets way
80:59,4859.23,4.22,from Smith drives left hand it off the glass
81:04,4864.45,5.67,and Steve Kerr going back to Harrison Barnes I'm sure for as Ely and love
81:10,4870.12,6.12,coming back in as well that is no knocked as Ely just bad been planning as
81:16,4876.24,6.12,far as putting him on the body of LeBron James it's easy office and you're allowing him to attack once again as Ely
81:22,4882.36,5.43,James this time goes Adam pulls back to point shots and green grabs another
81:28,4887.79,7.38,rebound his 12th curry downtown off the mark
81:35,4895.17,8.64,Jefferson able a snare it and Mike we're used to seeing that's great off it's a great screen him wide open for what used
81:44,4903.81,7.71,to seeing that one going down Irving's trying to get away from the double-team throws it back up to James James to
81:52,4911.52,7.08,Smith seven to shoot James backing up against curry 1 on the

82:11,4931.34,5.91,his Ely we've had 20 lead changes and 11
82:17,4937.25,5.10,ties and the reason why that doesn't hurt you defense Lee because marine is
82:22,4942.35,5.91,defending Tristan Thompson so when the pick-and-roll comes is green switch him with Iguodala and it makes you better
82:28,4948.26,6.33,offensively also with bonds on the floor game 7 is tied with three and a half to
82:35,4954.59,2.90,go here on the 4th

82:54,4974.07,8.51,into quickly now we're gonna see Jo Smith probably set the screen Jenny curry in the action
83:03,4983.24,6.34,curry now picks them up five to shoot James powers drives and Alain missed it

83:28,5008.21,5.19,as we get under the 3-minute mark but
83:33,5013.40,5.25,you want to win this has got to be the mindset this is good defense and good offense that's both ways championship

89:04,5344.27,6.34,doesn't allow him to get to the paint LeBron takes to spill hopefully he's all right but that's the right defensive
89:11,5350.61,6.84,play by draymond Green James holding on to that right wrist of it the medical staff and almost the

90:07,5407.26,8.03,trouble getting the ball in if Golden State scores it's going you cannot have any more timeouts
90:15,5415.29,7.89,so James will go to the free-throw line a hard fall he's 7 of 8 from the line

91:45,5504.94,6.57,in the sleep horses the late contest that's a big-time offensive play by Kyrie Irving but it's a play he's made
